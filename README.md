### 📝 Brett's Public Notes

This repo contains some of my public notes on a few tools that I use. I'm always learning, so I keep this repo updated always. My notes offer...

- an introduction to various services for my students and...
- a quick reference for rules, syntax and commands.

In the age of the internet, no one should have to remember everything.

For some of these services, I've mostly catered to macOS with Homebrew. For my desktop PC, I use [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) and [NSSM](http://nssm.cc/) for services, and Linux has its own CLI tools. Eventually I'll add additional notes for PC & Linux.

If you're on a PC, you may consider [dual booting with Ubuntu](/devops/dualboot-pc-linux.md) or maybe try a [hackintosh](https://github.com/brettinternet/hackintosh). While I do have my own PCs, I believe Unix systems are better for developing.
