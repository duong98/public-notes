*Setup instructions for my students:* Install both the Postgres server and the GUI client. You can interact with the Postgres server from the command line, but you may find that using a GUI client like pgAdmin is helpful at first.

If you choose to use Postgres from the command line, [use this cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546) to learn new commands.

1. **DO NOT** change the default port. `5432` is a commonly appointed port for postgresql
1. Install Postgres depending on your operating system



# macOS

### Server
Choose *one* of the following ways to install the Postgres server on macOS:

###### (a) App
1. [Download PostgreSQL](http://postgresapp.com/) and add to your Applications folder.
1. Open the Postgres app from your applications to start the server.

###### (b) Homebrew
1. `brew install postgresql`
1. `brew services start postgresql` or replace start with `run` if you don't want postgres to start at login


### Setup
1. Try running `psql` in the terminal. If you get an error about the command not being found, then run the following command before using PSQL:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin
```
1. If you get an error, you may need to run `createdb` for postgres to create a default DB under your username. Try `psql` again to start postgresql cli with your username

Or login with the default user: `psql -d postgres`

To quit it, type `\q` then Enter.

### Client
Install [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/). It's good practice to learn pgAdmin since it offers cross-platform support. Open the `.dmg` file and drag the `pgAdmin.app` to your Applications folder.


You may consider using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/), another Postgres client that's very easy to use.



# Windows

### Server
1. Open the [Postgres downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and select **Download the graphical installer** from BigSQL.
1. Choose the latest Postgres version, then select **Windows x86-64** and *Download*.
1. Open up the installer and allow it to make changes on your machine.
1. Run the installer and select all default settings including the default port.
1. **If you are asked to enter a password for Postgres, remember that password**.

### Client
The windows client includes pgAdmin with it. Select `Start` or click the Windows key and search for **pgAdmin** to find the app.

If you somehow don't have pgAdmin installed or you have an older version installed, you can install [pgAdmin 4 here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).



# Ubuntu

### Server
1. `sudo apt-get install postgresql`
1. Follow [this guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/serverguide/postgresql.html) for postgresql database setup on ubuntu. There are some helpful answers [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge), too.


# Additional Setup and Usage
#### Listening for connections
By default, Postgresql only listens to localhost. For postgresql to accept other connections besides `127.0.0.1` you must modify the postgresql config file. Sudoedit `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf` and change `listen_addresses='localhost'` either add additional addresses postgres should accept or `listen_addresses='*'` to accept all connections.

Finally, restart the server with `sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart`.

#### Remote connection
Use `psql -h hostname -U username -d database` to then connect remotely.


## PSQL
Here are some important commands that may save you some frustration:

- To quit psql, type `\q` then Enter.
- Every SQL command must end with a `;` in order for the command to run. If you don't enter a `;`, using Enter will carry you to the next line.


# Troubleshooting
You're welcome to connect to the postgres server with your computer's username, but if you'd like to use the the commonly used default credentials 'postgres' user, you may get an error that says `postgres role does not exist`. If you do get this error, then do the following:
1. enter `psql` in terminal and input these commands in the psql instance:
```
CREATE USER postgres SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE postgres WITH OWNER postgres;
```
1. You can enter `\du` to see a list of users. You should see both your computer's username and 'postgres' listed.
