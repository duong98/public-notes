# Application
- [Companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and don't make you fill out long and tedious applications

Rules:
1. Talk to real people at the very least by email or LinkedIn. Sending applications without contacting someone from the company is a black hole.
1. Start small and work your way up. Make your objective to get interviews and talk to people at companies. Some interviews at jobs you're less interested in will prepare you for more difficult ones.
1. **Study!** Bootcamp grads do have [some weak spots](http://blog.triplebyte.com/bootcamps-vs-college). Here are some study materials:
- [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)
- [System Designs](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/60)
- [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656) is an alternative to [CTCI](https://github.com/careercup/ctci)

- [This is a clojure whiteboard problem](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-acing-the-technical-interview), but it's written so beautifully it's worth a mention.

###### Whiteboarding Approach
1. write sample data
2. solve your own sample data (without code)
3. pseudo-code, define the steps in the process in verbose
4. write the code solution


### Ask the Interviewer Questions
- What are some technical challenges youâ€™ve recently faced?
- What do you enjoy about working at X company?
- How are teams structured and how are tasks usually divided?

[This list has about every question you'd ever need to ask a prospective employer](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/InterviewThis).

##### Learn what you want
- Let the interview know [what values you're looking for](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries) in a company. ([discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15908812))
- Look at the company's Glassdoor reviews and bring up any other concerns you have about the position or company.
