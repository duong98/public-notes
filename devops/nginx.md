# Install
1. `apt-get nginx` to install
1. After install use `systemctl status nginx` to confirm the service is running. Then visit your local IP address to confirm nginx is working. You should see a welcome message from nginx.


# Nginx Files
- From [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04).
`/var/www/html`: The actual web content, which by default only consists of the default Nginx page you saw earlier, is served out of the `/var/www/html` directory. This can be changed by altering Nginx configuration files.

### Server Configuration
- `/etc/nginx`: The nginx configuration directory. All of the Nginx configuration files reside here.
- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`: The main Nginx configuration file. This can be modified to make changes to the Nginx global configuraiton.
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available`: The directory where per-site "server blocks" can be stored. Nginx will not use the configuration files found in this directory unless they are linked to the sites-enabled directory (see below). Typically, all server block configuration is done in this directory, and then enabled by linking to the other directory.
- `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`: The directory where enabled per-site "server blocks" are stored. Typically, these are created by linking to configuration files found in the sites-available directory.
- `/etc/nginx/snippets`: This directory contains configuration fragments that can be included elsewhere in the Nginx configuration. Potentially repeatable configuration segments are good candidates for refactoring into snippets.

### Server Logs
`/var/log/nginx/access.log`: Every request to your web server is recorded in this log file unless Nginx is configured to do otherwise.
`/var/log/nginx/error.log`: Any Nginx errors will be recorded in this log.


### Certbot
Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt and [certbot](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04).
