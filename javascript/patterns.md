## Model-view-controller is an application architectural pattern.
The `model` is the data and data-management of the app. It manages fundamental behavior/data of the application, responds to requests and instructions to change the state of its information.

The `view` is the UI that renders the data from the model.

The `controller` receives user input and makes calls to the model objects and view to perform appropriate actions.



## REST
REST is REpresentational State Transfer is an architectural style for managing state information. Take a look at [where it all began](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)

REST-compliant web servers allow manipulating client and server data by using a set of stateless operations: C.R.U.D. (create, read, update, delete) which translate into some HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

REST conforms to [these constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_properties).

[How I explained REST to my wife](http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284) - the original other removed the article because of the possibly discriminatory wording in the title, but post is still educational (for man or woman).
