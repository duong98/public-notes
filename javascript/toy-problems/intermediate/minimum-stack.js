// Implement a stack which keeps track of its minimum value.
// Challenge: can you keep the operation time complexity to `O(1)`?
// Hint: Try using some extra space. What data structure might work for keeping track of minimums?

// your code here

stack.pushAll([1, 2, 3, 5, 0])
console.log(stack.getMinimum())
