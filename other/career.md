# Job Search
- [Here are Utah's larger companies](http://www.bigleap.com/utahs-best-brightest/)

# Application
- [Companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and don't make you fill out long and tedious applications

Rules:
1. Talk to real people at the very least by email or LinkedIn. Sending applications without contacting someone from the company is a black hole.
1. Start small and work your way up. Make your objective to get interviews and talk to people at companies. Some interviews at jobs you're less interested in will prepare you for more difficult ones.
1. **Study!** Bootcamp grads do have [some weak spots](http://blog.triplebyte.com/bootcamps-vs-college). Here are some study materials:
- [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)
- [System Designs](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/60)
- [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656) is an alternative to [CTCI](https://github.com/careercup/ctci)
- [Reddit's how to prepare for tech interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/)
- [algorithm and Data Structure resource](https://leetcode.com/)
