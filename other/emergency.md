# What to do in the event of an emergency?

### What to take:
- Wallet items: ID, Credit/Debit cards, cash
- Phone, laptop, and data (server drives?)
- Comfortable clothing
- Irreplaceable items: wedding ring, photos, documents
- Homeowner's policy
- Prescription medication

Then, take photos of everything in the house


### After the disaster
1. Take photos (don't clean up yet)
1. Call an insurance adjuster. Hire a public adjuster or use your broker or lawyer
