Make a simple React app, broken down into individual components.

This app should have Button, Input, and Greeting components.

It should take a name into the Input, and update on the page to say 'Hello <name>!'

The button should reset state, clearing the greeting.

File structure has been provided for you, and some starter code in the files.
