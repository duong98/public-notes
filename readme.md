### Brett's Public Notes

This repo contains some of my public notes on a few tools that I use. My notes offer...

- an introduction to various services for some of the students that I mentor and...
- a quick reference for rules, syntax and commands for myself.

In the age of the internet, no one should have to remember everything.

For some of these services, I've mostly catered to macOS with Homebrew. For PC, checkout [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) or apt-get on Linux. Eventually I'll add additional notes for PC/Linux.
