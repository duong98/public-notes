### Brett's Public Notes

This repo contains some of my public notes on a few tools that I use. My notes offer...

- an introduction to various services for my students and...
- a quick reference for rules, syntax and commands.

In the age of the internet, no one should have to remember everything.

> Everything not saved will be lost.

> \- _Nintento "Quit Screen" message_

For some of these services, I've mostly catered to macOS with Homebrew. For PC, checkout [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/). Eventually I'll add additional notes for PC & Linux.
